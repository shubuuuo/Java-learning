/* 
    There are two versions of JavaScript.
    First is Older version and second is newer version.
    In order to contain them both, they are both avalaible on JS.
    Therefore,
    We need to know which version we are using so we need to define it first.
    The "use strict" function lets us to use stictly newer version.
